What do I want to accomplish?
- I want to see how Iowa guard Caitlin Clark performed against other teams during her career.
- We can have this data timely for when the tournament comes around.

Cleaning Steps
- Import data
- Clean columns and remove the bottom one
- label home and away in the proper column
- do group_by and summarize on the important data points

Questions to answer
- What team does Caitlin Clark perform best against
- How many points (total points) has she scored against each team (and avg)
- How many assists, rebounds 3PM, 3p% etc... other relevant stats
- What conference does she do best against?
