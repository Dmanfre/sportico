------- Data Exploration Section -----------

Here I will answer the obvious outstanding questions and try to formulate a story narrative after it.

Which conference has most players

```{r}
# totals per conf
conf_counts23_24 <- non_us_23_24 %>% 
  filter(division == "I") %>% 
  group_by(conference) %>% 
  summarize(players_23_24 = n())
  
  conf_counts_22_23 <- non_us_22_23 %>% 
  filter(division == "I") %>% 
  group_by(conference) %>% 
  summarize(players_22_23 = n())
  
  total_conf <- inner_join(conf_counts23_24, conf_counts_22_23, by = "conference")
  
  #internationals
by_conf <- all_players %>% 
  group_by(conference) %>% 
  summarise(int_players_23_24 = sum(int_players_23_24),
            int_players_22_23 = sum(int_players_22_23))
#joining
all_conf <- inner_join(by_conf, total_conf, by="conference")

all_conf <- all_conf %>%  
  mutate(diff= int_players_23_24 - int_players_22_23,
         conf_perc_23_24 = int_players_23_24/sum(int_players_23_24)*100,
         conf_int_perc_22_23 = int_players_22_23/sum(int_players_22_23)*100)
```

which countries produce the most players

```{r}
#23-24
countries_23_24 <- non_us_23_24 %>% 
    group_by(country_clean) %>% 
  summarize(int_players = n()) %>%

countries_22_23 <- non_us_22_23 %>% 
  group_by(country_clean) %>% 
  summarize(int_players = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(int_players))

# joining
total_country <- inner_join(countries_23_24, countries_22_23, by = "country_clean")

total_country <- total_country %>%

         int_players_22_23 = int_players.y) %>%

         perc_22_23 = int_players_22_23/sum(int_players_22_23)*100,
  perc_change = ((int_players_23_24 - int_players_22_23) / int_players_22_23) * 100)

# per team
non_us_22_23 %>% 
  filter(team == "South Florida") %>% 
  group_by(country_clean) %>% 
  summarize(int_players = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(int_players))

--------------- Labeling tournament teams -------------------
Steps
- on the `all_players` df, add two columns. One called ncaat23_24 and one called ncaat22_23.
- write a case_when to put y if they were a tournament team and a n if they were not in 2023... do the same for 23-24
- Then filter teams that were a tourney team and had >0 international players.

```{r}
# 22-23 tournament teams

# Confirmed this now is 68 teams


ncaat_22_23 <- c("Arizona", "Creighton", "Holy Cross", "Illinois", "Marquette", "Maryland", "Mississippi State", "Norfolk State", "Notre Dame", "Oklahoma", "Portland", "Sacramento State", "South Carolina", "South Florida", "Southern Utah", "UCLA", "West Virginia", "Alabama", "Baylor", "Chattanooga", "Iowa State", "James Madison", "North Carolina", "Ohio State", "Purdue", "Saint Louis", "South Dakota State", "St. John's", "Tennessee", "Toledo", "UConn", "Southern Cal", "Vermont", "Virginia Tech",  "Cleveland State", "Florida Gulf Coast", "Gardner-Webb", "Hawaii", "Indiana", "LSU", "Miami", "Michigan", "Monmouth", "NC State", "Oklahoma State", "Princeton", "Tennessee Tech", "UNLV", "Utah", "Villanova", "Washington State", "Colorado", "Drake", "Duke", "East Carolina", "Florida State", "Georgia", "Gonzaga", "Iona", "Iowa", "Louisville", "Middle Tennessee", "Mississippi", "Sacred Heart", "Southeastern Louisiana", "Southern", "Stanford", "Texas")

```


```{r}
# putting a y or n if a school was a tourney team in 22-23
ncaat_teams <- all_players %>%
  mutate(tourny_team_22_23 = case_when(

    TRUE ~ "n"
  ))
```


```{r}
#Filtering to see what the tourney teams looked like w internationals
# Unsure of why this produces 67 and not 68
ncaa_yes22_23 <- ncaat_teams %>% 
  filter(tourny_team_22_23 == "y") %>% 
  select(team, conference, int_players_22_23, total_22_23, int_players_22_23, int_player_perc_22_23) %>% 
  arrange(desc(int_player_perc_22_23))
```


```{r}
# doing the same process for 2024
#adding column 

ncaat_teams_both_yrs <- ncaat_teams %>%
  mutate(tourny_team_23_24 = case_when(
    team %in% ncaat23_24 ~ "y",
    TRUE ~ "n"
  ))

# 23-24 teams international list
ncaa_yes23_24 <- ncaat_teams_both_yrs %>% 
  filter(tourny_team_23_24 == "y") %>%
